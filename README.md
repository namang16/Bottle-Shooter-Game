# Bottle Shooter Game

This project is one of the examples for the to demonstrate the features and scope of Computer Graphics and its Applications.

For understanding the depth of the subject of computer graphics and for gaining sound knowledge in this field, this is an attempt to take the first step in this field. 

We tried to make a Graphically Designed Bottle Shooter Game. This Bottle Shooter Game is made with the application of C-Graphics. This project applied the subject of Computer Graphics and made the game which is easy to play as well as enjoyable. It has different background themes, attractive display, mouse and keyboard-controlled animations and sound effects too.

We hope that with this project users can have a refreshing time playing a simple game during their stressful life.

This project was done with the help of C-Programming Language.  Different methods are performed in order to make it more applied and efficient. C Graphics Programming is very easy and interesting and is thus used for developing this project, its designing and inbuilt animations.
